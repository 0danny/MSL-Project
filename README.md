# Minecraft Server Launcher

#### A server launcher to simplify and make the lives easier of small server owners, or just people that want to run a server and have a clean UI while they are doing it.

Still working on it in my spare time and not really releasing builds or putting serious thought into it, more just a fun project. Your more than welcome to build it and give me any feedback you like.
